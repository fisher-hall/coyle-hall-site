### Profile
My name is Joey Quinones, rector of Coyle Hall. Originally from Southern California, I have been in and affiliated with the University of Notre Dame since 2014 when I entered as a First Year student. In 2018, I graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Theology. In 2020, I graduated from the ACE program with a Master’s in Education, having taught 5th grade in Tulsa, Oklahoma for two years. In 2021, I graduated Notre Dame for the final time with a Master’s of Science in Entrepreneurship through the ESTEEM program. During this year, I was an Assistant Rector in Baumer Hall, a foray into becoming the rector of Fisher Hall beginning the following year.

Being the rector of Fisher Hall has been one of the greatest joys of my life. It has challenged my ability to love and care for others and what it means to believe in the development of the human person. Witnessing the growth of these young men and possibly having a hand in it is one of the coolest things. There is no greater privilege than to be welcomed into the life of another person, and I work every day to respect that privilege. This year, I am looking forward with eager anticipation of the joys and challenges that come with leading the new community of Coyle Hall. My goal for the year is for the community to live into this new identity, supported by our previous identity. In addition to being a rector, I am also an Assistant Coach of the Women’s and Men’s Boxing Clubs and work part-time for the McDonald Center for Student Well-being.
